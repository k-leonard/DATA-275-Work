        <span>
            In this problem we have been tasked with determining the mass of Jupiter.
            We are given information inside two CSV files that correspond to Jupiter's
            data and the Moon's data. Some of the data that we are given corresponds
            to both Jupiter and the Moon's JD, right ascension, declination, and distance in AU. 
        </span>

<!-- UNDERSTANDING THE DATA -->
        <h3>Understanding the Data</h3>
        <span>
            First and foremost, it is appropriate to show what the data looked like
            prior to cleaning. Below is a screenshot of what the data actually looks like.
        </span>

        <span>
            It is evident that the data points look a little messy for calculation. So in the next step, 
            we formatted the right ascension and declination from this messy format, into separate columns
            corresponding to their hours, minutes, and seconds. 
        </span>

<!-- CLEANING THE DATA -->
        <h3>Cleaning the Data</h3>

        <span>
            We created two function that would clean our data by separating each hour, minute, and second
            into its own column by splitting on the delimeter (a space). Once we were able to split them into their 
            own columns, we then pasted the HMS into HH:MM:SS format for future use if needed.
        </span>

        <span>
            Once we separated each HMS into their own columns, we mutated both the Jupiter data
            and the Moon data, such that we calculate the single numerical value for declination
            and right ascension.

        <span>Our new and reformed data looks as follows</span>

<!-- JOINING AND MAKING CALCULATIONS ON THE DATA -->
        <h3>Joining and analyzing our data</h3>
        <span>
            It is important to note at this time, that we needed to take the difference between the moon's
            position and Jupiter's position to get the moon's position relative to the planet. To accomplish
            this, we joined the two tables together into a master dataframe. We joined the two together
            to make it easier to calculate things between the moon and Jupiter if needed for later. 
        </span>

        <span>
            After joining the two tables together, we were able to plot the peaks and troughs
            of the orbits against JD. By doing so, we are able to take a rough estimate of the orbital period.
        </span>

<!-- CALCULATIONS -->
        <h3>Making Calculations</h3>
        <span>
            To be able to get the mass, we must first find the orbital period, semi_major axis, and 
            calculate the angular separation in order to be applied to the mass equation. It is appropriate
            at this time to note that the equation for the total mass of a planet is the average_separation^3 / years^2.
            We will now go through the steps necessary to get the total mass
        </span>

        <h4>Step 1. Calculating the Orbital Period</h4>
        <span>
            We start by analyzing the peaks and troughs we found prior. Looking between the lowest two
            troughs, we are able to estimate the min_jd and the max_jd, which, if subtracted, will give us the number of days
            it took for an orbit to complete in full. We then want to make it useful for us in our calculations of total
            mass by converting the total number of days into years. 
        </span>

        <h4>Step 2. Calculating the Angular Separation</h4>
        <span>
            After calculating the Orbital Period, we need to calculate the angular separation
            to get the separation between Jupiter and the Moon. We then use theta (semi major axis)
            to convert the degrees between the two objects into a distance between them. 
        </span>

        <h4>Step 3. Calculating the Total Mass</h4>
        <span>
            Now that we have the orbital period and the angular separations, we can calculate
            the total mass using the average separation and the orbital period in years!
